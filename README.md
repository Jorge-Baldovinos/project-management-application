# Project Management Application

## Description
This [website](https://jorge-baldovinos.github.io/project-management-application/) allows you to manage tasks by assigning a title, due date, and description to cards that can be moved through the to-do, in progress, and done stages. The code was refactored with the intention of utilizing bootstrap to add a modal and jquery to enable task card creation and deletion.

## Usage

The user is initially presented with a task board that contains three sections labeled To Do, In Progress, and Done. The user can add tasks by clicking the green button which opens a modal for input.

Users can input the task title, due date, and description, within the modal.

When the user clicks on the due date input field, a calendar will appear where they can select a date.

After the user has assigned the task details and clicked on the "add task" button in the modal, a new task card will be created in the "to do" section. The user can then choose to either add another task or move the card to a different stage by dragging it. The user may also click on the delete button to delete the task card.

The task cards will also appear color coded based off their due date. Red cards indicate past due, while yellow cards indicate upcoming due dates.
